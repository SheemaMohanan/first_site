# Parallax Web page

Parallax websites are perfect for the user journey.As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion.Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.
Here in this project I used HTML and Internal CSS. And I used some external links in this project like :
<ol><li>https://www.keralatourism.org/where-to-stay/</li>
<li>https://www.keralatourism.org/ebrochures/</li>
<li>https://www.keralatourism.org/visa-requirement/</li>
<li>https://www.keralatourism.org/traveller/</li><ol> etc.
